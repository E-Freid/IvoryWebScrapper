# Ivory Renewed Products Catalog Scraper
## About this Project:
as a former employe of ivory, I used to browse the renewed products catalog for great deals, and bought a couple of products from there (which were in a great condition). Somewhere around 2021-2022, long after I quit the job, ivory created a renewed catalog on their website, and now everyone can look and check for a great deal on a renewed product. I decided to do so as well, however, there are a lot of products, and sometimes it's hard to go back and forth to check if you are looking at a good deal. hence, came this idea!

## How does it work?:
this program uses selenium library and functions to loop through the renewed products catalog, and then compere each renewed product to a new one(if a new one exists in the store) and shows in the console if its a great deal or not :).  (a deal is great if the difference is at least 15% in price)

## What do you need to use the program?:
1. python 3 installed on your computer
2. stable internet connection (the better the connection, the faster the program)

## what is next?:
1. performence improvent: at this moment, the program works as expected, however it can be slow at times. this is why performence improvment is the top priority
2. some kind of starting menu: a menu at the start of the program, where users can use inputs to filter out some deals
